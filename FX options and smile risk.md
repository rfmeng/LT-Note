<h2>C1. The FX Market</h2>
Two main interbank platforms: EBS and Reuter Dealing
<h3>1.1 FX RATES AND SPOT CONTRACTS</h3>
The euro/US dollar FX rate is identified by the label EURUSD and it denotes how many US dollars are worth 1 euro. The domestic (numeraire) currency is the US dollar and the foreign (base) currency is the euro.</br>
Two examples are: “I Buy (or Sell) 2 mios EURUSD at 1.3597” and “I Buy 1 mio USD against EUR at 1.3597”.</br>
T+2 settlement rule

<h3>1.2 OUTRIGHT AND FX SWAP CONTRACTS</h3>
Outright = forward</br>
use money market conventions to price the deposits</br>
no arbitrage FX rate condition:
<ul><li>counterparty not subject to default risk</li>
<li>no limit to borrow the money</li></ul>
outright contracts are quoted in forward points: $\textbf{Fpts}(t,T)=F(t,T)-S_t$</br>
<h4>swap</h4>
“I buy and sell back 1 mio EUR against USD in 3 months” means means that the trader enters into a spot contract buying 1 million euros against US dollars, and then sells them back at the expiry of the FX swap in three months’ time.</br>
par (alternatively an even)(means equal notional amount) FX swap and a non-par (alternatively an uneven or split or change) FX swap</br>
two points
<ul><li>
The forward rate $F(t,T)$ determined as in equation (1.1) does not identify the unique arbitrage-free price</li>
<li>The forward price implied by an FX swap contract can be different from that of an outright contract when default of the counterparty is considered</li></ul>
